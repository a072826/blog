I am a Data Psychologist. My research tries to find the best ways to incorporate data science techniques into psychological research. My present research focuses on building a machine learning model to identify mentally maladaptive students with big data including time-serial LMS (Learning Management System) data, academic performance, and psychological assessments. 
 
I am currently working as a data scientist at the Office of Digital Information of Korea University, participating in a governmental project (University Innovation Project). My responsibilities include preprocessing big data, making data pipeline, building machine learning models, and writing monthly and annual reports. 

Prior to this position, I was a clinical researcher at the students counseling center of Korea University, conducting research on developing and validating psychological measurements, and developing an automatized psychological reporting system from the scratch. I also provide personal and group interventions for university students.
