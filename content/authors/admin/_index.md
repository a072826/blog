I am a Data Psychologist. My research tries to find the best ways to incorporate data science techniques into psychological research. My research interest is mainly on developing novel assessment methods to supplement the limitations of self-reports. 

I am currently working as a data scientist at the Office of Digital Information of Korea University, participating in a series of AI projects. The present project focuses on building an automatic assessment model to monitor studentsâ€™ psychological adaptation.

Prior to this position, I was a clinical researcher at the students counseling center of Korea University, conducting research on developing and validating psychological measurements, and developing an automatized psychological reporting system from the scratch.
